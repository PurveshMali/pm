8. Write a program that asks the user for a
number and outputs the number squared
that is entered
void setup() {
// put your setup code here, to run once:
Serial.begin(9600);
Serial.println(&quot;input the number&quot;);
}

void loop() {
// put your main code here, to run
repeatedly:

int input = Serial.parseInt(); // keep other
operations outside the sq function
int inputSquared = sq(input);
Serial.print(int(inputSquared));

delay(500);
}
